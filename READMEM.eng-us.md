# Practical test Git and GitHub

This project was created to practice essential commands and worflows using Git
and GitHub

## Objectives of this test

- Learn to initialize a repository ('git init')
- Work with branches ('git branch', 'git checkout')
- Perform merges and simulate conflicts
- Practice push, pull, clone and reset
- Use GitHub to manage versions and pull requests

## What i did

- Creation of fictional files ('texto_1.txt', 'texto_2.txt',
'sistemadelogin.txt', etc.)
- Simulation of merge with conflict resolution
- Test commands such as:
  - 'git init', 'git add', 'git commit'
  - 'git branch', 'git checkout', 'git merge'
  - 'git push', 'git pull', 'git clone', 'git reset'
  - Created pull request in GitHub

## Learnings

 - Understood of the importance of branches to parallel development
 - Learned the workflow 'add -> commit -> pull'
 - Gained experience resolving basic conflicts
 - Got familiar with GitHub interface

## Observations

- This project contains fictional files only for version control practice
- It does not represent a real or functional software project
